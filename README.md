## Adventure Trails Hikes - Semester Project Resit 1

## Project Overview
This project is a resit submission for the Front-end Development 1 (FED1-24) Semester Project 1 at Noroff. The goal is to develop a static website for **Adventure Trails Hikes**, a business offering extreme hiking experiences in various countries, focusing on nature, culture, and sustainability. The target audience is college-educated professionals aged 18â€“35. The site has been built from scratch to meet the brief and improve on my original submission.

## Features
- **Pages**: 5 pages (Homepage, Hikes, Culture, Sustainability, Contact).  
- **Design**: Responsive, accessible (WCAG-compliant), and visually appealing for young professionals, modeled after Charlie's Wanderings.  
- **Content**: Highlights hiking experiences, cultural immersion, and eco-friendly practices, with prices and travel details.  
- **SEO**: Includes meta tags and keywords for better search visibility.  
- **Performance**: Images optimized to <200kb for fast loading, tested with Google PageSpeed Insights.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally.  
No additional dependencies are required as this is a static site using HTML and CSS.

## Usage
- **Live Site**: [Insert live site URL here, e.g., Netlify or GitHub Pages link].  
- **Navigation**: Use the sticky header to access all pages (hamburger menu on mobile).  
- **Accessibility**: Navigate using keyboard (Tab key) for WCAG compliance.  

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Homepage with hero image, featured hikes, and a call-to-action section.  
- `hikes.html`: Detailed list of extreme hikes with prices and cultural/sustainability details.  
- `culture.html`: Cultural experiences tied to hiking trips (e.g., Peruvian Pachamama ceremony).  
- `sustainability.html`: Eco-friendly practices of the business (e.g., community partnerships).  
- `contact.html`: Static contact form with accessibility features.  
- `styles.css`: External stylesheet with DRY principles and responsive design.  
- `assets/images/`: Optimized images for hikes and culture (e.g., sunrise.jpg, peru.jpg).  

## Development Process
- **Planning**: Used Trello for milestones and tasks ([Trello board link]).  
- **Design**: Created a style guide with earthy tones and clean typography, inspired by Charlie's Wanderings, along with mobile and desktop prototypes.  
- **Development**: Built 5 pages with semantic HTML and responsive CSS, ensuring WCAG compliance.  
- **Testing**: Currently testing accessibility with WAVE, responsiveness across devices, and performance with Lighthouse.  

## Improvements from Original Submission
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Added WCAG-compliant contrast, alt text, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.  
- **Improved Semantic HTML**: Used `<article>`, `<nav>`, and proper heading structures.  
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduced image sizes for faster load times, aiming for <3 seconds.
