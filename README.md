## Adventure Trails Hikes - Semester Project Resit 1

## Project Overview
This project is a resit submission for the Front-end Development 1 (FED1-24) Semester Project 1 at Noroff. The goal is to develop a static website for **Adventure Trails Hikes**, a business offering extreme hiking experiences in various countries, focusing on nature, culture, and sustainability. The target audience is college-educated professionals aged 18–35. The site reuses code from my previous Gutwell website project (with approval from Mr. Abudu) and has been adapted to meet the new brief and improve on my original submission.

## Features
- **Pages**: 5 pages (Homepage, Hikes, Culture, Sustainability, Contact).  
- **Design**: Responsive, accessible (WCAG-compliant), and visually appealing for young professionals.  
- **Content**: Highlights hiking experiences, cultural immersion, and eco-friendly practices, with maps, prices, and travel details.  
- **SEO**: Includes meta tags and keywords for better search visibility.  
- **Performance**: Images optimized to <200kb for fast loading, tested with Google PageSpeed Insights.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally.  
No additional dependencies are required as this is a static site using HTML and CSS.

## Usage
- **Live Site**: [Insert live site URL here, e.g., Netlify or GitHub Pages link].  
- **Navigation**: Use the sticky header to access all pages (hamburger menu on mobile).
